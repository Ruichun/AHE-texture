# AHE-texture
AHE Texture: A mathematical code designed to determine the anomalous Hall vector σH and the corresponding multipoles in the magnetic order space—the magnetic moment for ferromagnets or the Néel vector for antiferromagnets—employing the extrinsic parameter method. For usage instructions, refer to the example "To Use.nb," and consult the theory in arXiv:2411.10147 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10147).
